# pyManifold
A library implementing the Lie Groups SO(2), SE(2), SO(3), and SE(3) in Python3. Based off of Transformations for Dummies by James Jackson and A Micro Lie Theory... by Sola.
Note that the quaternion class has the same functionality as SO3 but is more stable.

To install run this from the same directory as the README
pip3 install . --user
